# Model Registry Info

## Purpose

This directory is intended to store, track, and document machine learning models that have been trained, validated, and are ready for deployment or further evaluation.

## Best Practices

- **Versioning:**
  - Store each model artifact in a subdirectory named with a version or timestamp (e.g., `v1/`, `2024-05-01/`).
  - Include metadata files (e.g., `metrics.json`, `params.yaml`) describing the model, training data, and evaluation results.

- **Artifacts:**
  - Save serialized model files (e.g., `.pkl`, `.pt`, `.onnx`, `.joblib`) here.
  - Optionally, include export scripts or notebooks that generated the model.

- **Documentation:**
  - Add a `README.md` in each model version folder describing:
    - Model architecture
    - Training data
    - Performance metrics
    - Intended use cases

- **Integration:**
  - Reference the latest or production-ready model in your API or batch jobs.
  - Use this directory as a local registry, or connect to a remote registry (e.g., MLflow, S3) for production workflows.

## Example Structure

```
model_registry/
├── v1/
│   ├── model.pkl
│   ├── metrics.json
│   └── README.md
├── v2/
│   ├── model.pkl
│   ├── metrics.json
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
```

## Why Have a Model Registry?

- Ensures reproducibility and traceability of models.
- Makes it easy to roll back or promote models.
- Facilitates collaboration and handoff between data scientists and engineers.

*For advanced workflows, consider integrating with MLflow, DVC, or cloud-based registries.*
